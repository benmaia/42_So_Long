<p> This project is a very small 2D game. Its purpose is to make you work with textures, sprites and some other very basic gameplay elements!</p>
<p> To use it:</p>

```bash
git@github.com:benmaia/42_So_Long.git
```

```bash
cd so_long
```
<p> To run, use make to compile it and create the ./so_long, and pass the map as arguments, you can add your own map, or edit the existent one! </p>

```bash
make && ./so_long map2.ber
```

<p> If you just want to test it you can just run: </p>
  
```bash
make exe
```

<p> Make sure the map is covered by walls in it's sides, the map is rectangular, it cointains at least 1 C (collectible), 1 E (exit) and 1 P (player starting position)! If you want to add enemies you can add an X to the map!</p>
<p> To sort the numbers, we only had 2 stacks (a and b) and 4 types of movements, swap, push, rotate, and reverse rotate:</p>
